DONE:
- New algorithm for motion detection
- Implemented the plant, leaves float away modal confirm (sketch.js is now redundant)
- Linked all the buttons with App.js


TODO:
- Refine the layout
- I didn't have time to figure out why arduino wasn't working
- Suggestion: Have a table that logs transaction, after all that's what the blockchain is about
