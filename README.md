## Synopsis:

Can we create a self-regulating blockchain smart contract to financially incentivize mankind to extract resources in a more sustainable way? To find out, we rig a desktop mint plant to an office-only cryptocurrency so that the value of the currency is tied to the health of the plant. If you give the plant water, or take some leaves for your mint tea, the action will be logged in the blockchain ledger, and have an effect on the value of the currency. The idea is to make the plant autonomously tied to a micro-economy, with no need for an owner, and to incentivize our collective care and conscious harvesting of it through financial devices.

## Questions:

How can cryptocurrency and smart contracts apply to natural resources? Can blockchain be used to give more autonomy and authority to nature? Is it possible to use this new technology in financial policy to change the paradigm of natural resources, from one of extraction to partnership? An experiment with a small mint plant and a local cryptocurrency help us to discover an answer.
How did we think of this project? What was our process of making it, designing the interaction and engineering the code?


## Further Information:

Though the experiment exists in small scale, on an office desk, the project serves as a poetic metaphor for how we would hope humanity could behave towards its natural resources — a hope that we would invest in the future of our earth and home. And more than that, it actually is a financial system that incentivizes those positive behaviors. This idea, as an overall concept, has the possibility to be applied to other issues that suffer from the “tragedy of the commons”, such as public space, community gardens, national parks, and rainforests. In the end, it is simply using blockchain to attribute financial value to things (like forests), and allowing those things the ability to arbiter that value themselves, as independent actors.


## Performance Piece

100 Mint Teas: a performance to demonstrate cryptocurrency mining with a mint plant
Starting with one mint plant, administrators on the stage harvest mint leaves and make tea for members of the audience. Meanwhile the audience is prompted to invest in the mint plant with MintCoin, causing the plant to multiply. Another administrator brings more and more new plants from off stage with each increased investment. A screen above shows the changing value in MintCoin, as each participant takes a tea or makes an investment. Will the MintCoin crash, or will we all end up having actually mined more cryptocurrency? Either of those outcomes are a possibility–not even the administrators know what will be the outcome.


## Known Issues

- Sometimes when picking leaves the returned number is not up-to-date - this is a bug in the contract
