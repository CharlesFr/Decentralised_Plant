DONE:
- New algorithm for motion detection
- Implemented the plant, leaves float away when modal "confirm" button is pressed (sketch.js is now redundant)
- Linked all the buttons with App.js
- Button to send ETH to the contract

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:
- Refine the layout
- I didn't have time to figure out why Arduino wasn't working
- Get the MintCoin price to update
- Get the Moisture level to update
